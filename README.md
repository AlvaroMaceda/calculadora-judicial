## Development
If you are using rvm, enter the project gemset with ```rvm use .```
The first time you should install dependencies with ```bundle install```

Use ```rails server``` to launch the project in development mode. You can speed javascript and css reloading launching webpack in another shell: ```./bin/webpack-dev-server```

The project will be available at http://localhost:3000
