    Note that you can't use 'real' classes because classes defined into Month component
    will be more specific and they will overwrite your class properties, so you will have
    to use !important in each property.

    Example:
    <Month

            '2020-12-07': 'markStyleToApply',
            '2020-12-25': {background: 'salmon', color: 'white'},
